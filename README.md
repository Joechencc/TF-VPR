# How to run the code
The detailed step of running the code is included in each branch. This code includes Supervised, our method and SPTM baseline methods for three different inputs including simulated Pointcloud, Habitatsim RGB, and Real RGB

# How to collect input
For Pointcloud: Please refer to DeepMapping paper, https://github.com/ai4ce/PointCloudSimulator
For Habitat RGB: We just need RGB images and x,y,theta as input(for validation)
For Habitat RGB: We just need RGB_real images and x,y,theta as input(for validation)
                 Our real-world dataset will be available later
